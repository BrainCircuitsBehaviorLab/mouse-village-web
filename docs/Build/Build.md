To build the Mouse Village system, you'll need the following things:

1. **3D-Printed Parts**: Several parts that can be 3D printed using our provided STL files (Print them in the original orientation for accuracy).
2. **CNC Machined Parts**: Various components made from transparent and white acrylic.
3. **Electronic Components**: You'll need to purchase various electronic components. We have compiled a list of recommended parts and suppliers.
4. **Aluminium Extrusions and Tubes**: Structural parts like aluminium extrusions and acrylic tubes are required to build the frame, and connect the cages where the animals live.
5. **Animal cages**: We use 4 standard animal cages (Poner la marcas). You will need to make holes to each of the cages as to let them connect onto each other with the [template we provide][Hole Template].
